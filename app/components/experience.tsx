          India's first hindi based LLM named Project Indus.Conducted extensive data cleaning,
          preprocessing, and collection of over 20 million tokens to prepare high-quality datasets
          for training.Processed non-Hindi datasets by translating them into Hindi using tools
          like Google API and DeepTrans, ensuring accurate language conversion. Utilized transformer-based
          architectures to train the LLM, achieving 90% model efficiency on diverse Indian language datasets.`}
